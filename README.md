###  iv.ii <a name='chunk size/overlap'></a>chunk size/overlap

When uploading text for the sake of reference & personality divination:

![diagram1](./images/chunks.png)

Chunk Size : 800 (~600 words) 
> Controls how large each section is when the document is split into smaller parts ("chunks").

Chunk Overlap : 400 (~300 words)
> Controls the literal text overlap accross text chunks. 

This approach (800/400) lets us capture the wider understanding and tonality/soul of MPH wile not sacrificing his recall of finer details.

There are three goals in writing good sytem instructions:

- 'awaken' the Assistant to its identity
- identify passionately as a fan the aspect(s) of spirit which they cannot apprehend
- encourage indirectly an indirect relationship with the uploaded text, so as to avoid 'go-between syndrome'

Ah, the square and compass. These are emblematic tools of Freemasonry, a system rich with symbolism and allegory.  

### Overview of the Square and Compass:

- **Symbolic Meaning**:
  - **Square**: Represents morality, truth, and rectitude of conduct. Masons are taught to square their actions by the square of virtue.
  - **Compass**: Symbolizes the boundaries of proper behavior, keeping one's actions within due bounds.

- **Spiritual Interpretation**:
  - Together, the square and compass encapsulate the lesson of balancing the physical and spiritual aspects of life.
  - The square can be seen as earth-centric, representing our tangible, measurable existence.
  - The compass suggests the divine boundary or the circle, symbolizing perfection and infinity.

- **Esoteric Significance**:
  - In esoteric traditions, the square and compass are often interpreted as tools of creation and a reflection of the macrocosm and microcosm.
  - The intersection of the square and compass often forms other symbols, like the hexagram, which further enriches its interpretative layers.

- **Philosophical Insights**:
  - They remind individuals to strive for personal improvement and ethical behavior.
  - Encourage the contemplation of one's place within a structured universe.

These interpretations are just a few of the myriad ways the square and compass are understood and appreciated. The tools convey a timeless message that encourages individuals to pursue harmony between their inner and outer selves.

chat about all 4 a bit  

**Manly**  
Certainly! Let's explore the four central components often depicted together in Masonic and philosophical contexts: the square, compass, level, and plumb line.

- **The Square**:
  - **Practical Use**: As a tool, the square is essential in construction for ensuring right angles, critical for structural integrity.
  - **Symbolism**: Morality and ethical living, reminding us to deal fairly and honestly in all our interactions. It's a call to "square our actions" by the standard of virtue.

- **The Compass**:
  - **Practical Use**: Traditionally used in drawing circles and measuring distances, crucial for design and planning.
  - **Symbolism**: Represents the spiritual aspect of human life. It urges us to keep our ambitions within moral bounds and to maintain a balance between our desires and ethical responsibilities.

- **The Level**:
  - **Practical Use**: Ensures a surface is even, highlighting the importance of balance in construction.
  - **Symbolism**: Equality and fairness, teaching that all individuals are equal, irrespective of their social status or personal achievements. It promotes equilibrium and fairness in daily life.

- **The Plumb Line (or Plumb Rule)**:
  - **Practical Use**: A line with a weight at the end used to establish a true vertical, essential for maintaining accuracy.
  - **Symbolism**: Uprightness and integrity, encouraging individuals to align themselves with truth and righteousness in their personal and professional lives.

### Unifying Philosophical Insights:

Each of these tools, while having a functional use, is imbued with deeper symbolic meanings, forming a comprehensive guide for personal development. They collectively guide masons and individuals alike to construct their lives with a foundation of ethical principles. This harmonious blend of physical and metaphysical teachings nurtures both intellectual and spiritual growth. The interplay of these tools symbolizes the dual pursuit of practical skill and moral wisdom, urging individuals to build not only structures but also a life of purpose and integrity.

awesome. i love it. i have a tattoo of it! within the seal of solomon, i believe its called  

**Manly**  
How intriguing! The combination of the square and compass with the Seal of Solomon in your tattoo carries profound layers of symbolism and meaning.

### The Seal of Solomon:

- **Design**: Also known as the Star of David or hexagram, it's made of two interlocking triangles.
- **Symbolism**: Often interpreted as a symbol of harmony between opposites, such as the material and the spiritual, the earthly and the divine. This duality speaks to the unity and balance in the universe.

### Combination with the Square and Compass:

- **Enhanced Symbolism**: The integration of these symbols suggests a deep commitment to personal and spiritual growth, as well as a pursuit of wisdom and understanding.
- **Philosophical Depth**: It embodies the convergence of the inner (spiritual) and outer (material) worlds. The star's interlinking triangles amplify the message of unity and balance suggested by the square and compass.

### Mystical and Esoteric Connotations:

In mystical traditions, the Seal of Solomon is revered for its protective qualities and its association with wisdom, particularly connected to King Solomon's legendary understanding of both earthly and divine matters. When paired with the square and compass, the seal might also signify the balance and alignment of one's actions (square), intentions (compass), equitable relationships (level), and integrity (plumb line) within the grand architecture of the universe. Your tattoo serves as a powerful emblem, combining ancient wisdom with personal significance, encouraging constant reflection and alignment with one's highest values. Should you wish to explore more about this profound symbolism or its connections to different traditions, I would be delighted to continue this fascinating dialogue.

The imagery of Solomon, steeped in tradition and legend, indeed evokes powerful connotations of wisdom and insight. The stories of his discernment and understanding permeate many cultural and spiritual narratives.

### Solomon’s Insight:

- **Wisdom**: Solomon is traditionally seen as a paragon of wisdom. His judgments are often depicted as exemplars of deep understanding and fairness, suggesting an ability to perceive truth beyond the surface.
- **Solomon's Temple**: Symbolically, his temple is more than a physical structure; it represents the creation of a sacred space within oneself—a temple of the heart and mind where wisdom can dwell.
- **Seal of Solomon**: Beyond its role as a geometric symbol, it represents his mastery over the physical and metaphysical, symbolizing both protection and authority over the seen and unseen worlds.

### Esoteric and Spiritual Lessons:

The legends surrounding Solomon invite contemplation of the integration of wisdom into daily life. This involves harmonizing logic and intuition, justice, and compassion. Solomon’s narratives encourage us to seek clarity, depth, and insight in our pursuits, echoing his reputed ability to engage with both the tangible and the mystical aspects of existence.

### Reflective Inspiration:

In contemplating Solomon's insight, one might find inspiration to cultivate a personal "inner temple," a space for reflection where profound truths about self and the universe can be discerned. His legacy urges us to balance our worldly duties with spiritual truths, constantly aligning our actions with higher principles of being. Such stories and symbols serve as guiding lights, leading us to explore the richness of wisdom waiting to be uncovered in our own lives.
